       "u\"dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner . he was well rid of her . he certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle as ann . if he had married her , he'd have been asking for trouble . but all of this was rationalization . sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann , and then could not get back to sleep . his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing . the easiest thing would be to sell out to al budd and leave the country , but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it . the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work . he found that if he was tired enough at night , he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake . each day he found himself thinking less often of ann ; ; each day the hurt was a little duller , a little less poignant . he had plenty of work to do . because the summer was unusually dry and hot , the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years . the grass in the meadows came fast , now that the warm weather was here . he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water , so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows . he had no idea how much time budd would give him . in any case , he had no intention of being caught asleep , so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence . he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon , but nothing happened , each day dragging out with monotonous calm . when , in late afternoon on the last day in june , he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house , he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle . it could be some kind of trick budd had thought up . no one walked in this country , least of all ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew . morgan watched the two figures for a time , puzzled . when they were closer and he saw that one was a woman , he was more puzzled than ever . he cleaned his shovel , left it against the fence , picked up his winchester , and started downstream . his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow , angling toward the house . now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly , staggering , as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet . reaching the house ahead of them , he waited with his winchester in his hands . they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him , and now he saw that both were young , not more than nineteen or twenty . they were dirty , their clothes were torn , and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door . she lay there , making no effort to get back on her feet . the boy came on to the porch and sat down , his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring . morgan hesitated , thinking that if this was a trick , it was a good one . he didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending . the boy licked his dry lips . he asked , `` could we have a drink '' ? ? morgan jerked his head toward the front door . `` in the kitchen '' , he said . leaning his winchester against the front of the house , he walked to the girl . `` get up . there's water in the house '' . she didn't move or say anything . her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him . she had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked . her face was very thin , and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling , the new skin under it red and angry . her blond hair was frowzy , her dress torn in several places , and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection . it must have hurt her even to walk , for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding . he picked her up , sliding one hand under her shoulders , the other under her knees , and carried her into the house . she was amazingly light , and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious . any lingering suspicion that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled . no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him . besides , she had a sweet face that attracted him . he put her down on the couch , and going into the kitchen , saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table . they looked a good deal alike , morgan thought . both had blonde hair and blue eyes , and there was even a faint similarity of features . morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf , went back into the front room , lifted the girl's head , and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth . she drank greedily , and murmured , `` thank you '' , as he lowered her head . he stood looking down at her for a moment , wondering what could have reduced her to this condition . he had seen a few nester wagons go through the country , the families almost starving to death , but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two . the girl dropped off to sleep . morgan returned to the kitchen , built a fire , and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove . he brought his winchester in from the front of the house , then faced the boy . `` who are you and what happened to you '' ? ? he asked . `` i'm billy jones '' , the boy answered . `` that's my wife sharon . we ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days '' . `` what are you doing here '' ? ? `` are we in wyoming '' ? ? morgan nodded . `` about five miles north of the line '' . jones sighed as if relieved . `` we've been looking for work , but all the ranchers have turned us down '' . `` you mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work '' ? ? morgan demanded . `` the town of buckhorn's only about six miles from here . why didn't you go there '' ? ? `` we didn't want town work '' , jones said . `` this is a mighty empty country '' , morgan said . `` there's only one more ranch three miles north of here . you'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places '' . `` then we're lucky we got here . could you give us a job , mr. '' `` morgan . dan morgan '' . he was silent a moment , thinking he could use a man this time of year , and if the girl could cook , it would give him more time in the meadows , but he knew nothing about the couple . they might kill him in his sleep , thinking there was money in the house . he dismissed the possibility at once . the girl's thin face haunted him . it wasn't the face of a killer . he wasn't so sure about the boy . he hadn't shaved for several weeks , his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic , woebegone expression . there was more to this than jones had told him . they were running from something . he'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought , but he couldn't send them on , either . `` i could use some help '' , morgan said finally , `` but i can't afford to pay you anything . i guess you'd better go on in the morning '' . `` we'll work for our keep '' , the boy said eagerly . `` i've been mucking in a mine in the san juan , but i used to work on a ranch . sharon , she's cooked in a restaurant . we'll work hard , mr. morgan '' . `` i'll see '' , morgan said . `` right now you need a meal and a bath . your wife's in terrible shape '' . `` i know '' , jones said dejectedly . morgan filled the fire box with wood again , then started supper and set the table . when the meal was ready , he told jones to wash up , and going into the front room , woke the girl . he said , `` i've got some supper ready '' . she rubbed her eyes and stretched , then sat up , her hands going to her hair . `` i'm a mess '' , she said , and suddenly she was alarmed . `` who are you ? ? how did we get here '' ? ? `` i'm dan morgan . this is the rafter aj . you fell down in front of the house , and i carried you in . i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep '' . `` oh '' . she stared at him , her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said ; ; then she murmured : `` you're very kind , mr. morgan . do you take in all the strays who come by '' ? ? `` i don't have many strays coming to my front door '' , he said . `` think you can walk to the table '' ? ? `` of course '' . she got to her feet , staggered , and almost fell . he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen . she sat down at the table , shaking her head . `` i'm sorry , mr. morgan . i'm usually a very strong woman , but i'm awfully tired '' . `` and hungry '' , he said . `` start in . it's not much of a meal , but it's what i eat '' . `` not much of a meal '' ? ? the girl cried . `` mr. morgan , it's the best-looking food i ever saw '' . he told himself he had never seen two people eat so much . when they were finally satisfied , jones said , `` i think he's going to give us work '' . the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself . when he saw the expression in her eyes , he knew he couldn't send them on . she said , `` i guess the lord looks out for fools , drunkards , and innocents '' . morgan laughed . `` which are you '' ? ? `` we're not drunkards '' , she said . `` that's all i'm sure of '' . she helped him with the dishes , then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark . he carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall . he said : `` you'll feel a lot better after you have a bath . your feet are in bad shape , mrs. jones . you'll have to go to town to see the doc '' . `` no , she'll be all right '' , jones said quickly . `` i mean , we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town '' . `` we'll see '' , morgan said . `` could you find me a needle and thread '' ? ? the girl asked . `` my dress needs some work on it '' . he nodded and , going into the bedroom , brought a needle , thread , and scissors . he said : `` i'm going to bed '' . he nodded at the door in front of him . `` that's my spare bedroom . the bed isn't made , but you'll find plenty of blankets there '' . `` you're awfully kind '' , the girl said . `` we'll pay you back if you'll let us . some way '' . `` it's all right '' , he said . `` i get up early . you'd better sleep '' . jones followed him into the front room , closing the door behind him . he said : `` if it's all right with you , mr. morgan , i'll sleep out here on the couch . we haven't slept together since we started . i just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant , and if we were sleeping together '' he stopped , embarrassed , and morgan said , `` i understand that , but i don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place '' . `` we got fired '' , jones said . `` we had to do something '' . they were a pair of lost , whipped kids , morgan thought as he went to bed .\""
